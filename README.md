# Task Management API

## Project Description
This is a RESTful API for managing tasks, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.  
The API allows users to **register**, **login**, and **perform CRUD operations on tasks**. Each task is associated with the user who created it. Authentication is handled using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, ensuring secure access to user-specific resources.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x
- npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name

   
2. Install dependencies:
npm install


3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add:
conString=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
jwt_secret=<your_jwt_secret_key>
PORT=3000

4. Start the server
npm run dev

The server runs on http://localhost:3000.

Authentication & Role-Based Access
Authentication is done using JWT tokens. Users must include the token in the Authorization header in the format (Bearer <TOKEN>) for protected routes.

Role-based access can be added by extending the auth middleware to check user roles before granting access to specific routes. Currently, tasks are user-specific: each user can only access their own tasks.

Postman Collection
You can import this Postman collection to test the API:

Endpoints:
/api/v1/register (POST) – Register a user

/api/v1/login (POST) – Login to receive token

/api/v1/blog/ (GET, POST) – List and create tasks

/api/v1/blog/:taskId (GET, PATCH, DELETE) – Single task operations

Example Request Parameters:
Body: JSON with title, description, tag (for tasks which can be on these only- 'Important', 'Urgent', 'Later')

Headers: Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN> for protected endpoints

Example Response:
Returns JSON with success flag, task or user details, or errors for invalid inputs.

Authentication Flow:
Register a user.

Login to get JWT token.

Include JWT token in Authorization header for all task routes.

Access task routes; only tasks created by the logged-in user are returned/modified.

Happy coding!
